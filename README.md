# Iris Flower Classifier (KNN)

This project demonstrates my ability to build, train, and evaluate a **machine learning model** using Python and popular data science libraries.  
It classifies iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to correctly classify flowers into one of three Iris species:
- *Iris Setosa*  
- *Iris Versicolor*  
- *Iris Virginica*

I performed:
1. **Data loading and preprocessing** using `pandas`.
2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
3. **Model training and evaluation** with `scikit-learn`.
4. **Prediction** on new, unseen data to verify model performance.

## Key Features

- **Data analysis and visualization**: histograms, pairplots, and summary statistics.  
-  **KNN classifier** trained on the Iris dataset.  
-  **Accuracy and classification report** printed in the console.  
-  **Custom prediction** for a new flower sample.

Example output:
Accuracy: 0.95
precision recall f1-score support
Iris-setosa 1.00 1.00 1.00 16
Iris-versicolor 0.94 0.94 0.94 16
Iris-virginica 0.94 0.94 0.94 13

##  What I Learned

Through this project I practiced:
- Data cleaning and visualization.  
- Splitting data into training and test sets.  
- Training and evaluating ML models.  
- Understanding overfitting and model accuracy.  
- Making and interpreting predictions.

This project shows my ability to **apply core machine learning concepts** and use **Pythonâ€™s data science ecosystem effectively**.
